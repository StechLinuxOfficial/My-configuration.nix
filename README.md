# My-configuration.nix
This is a repo where you could find my configuration.nix file. I will only store this as a backup, but it is free to be taken by other users as well! It includes lots of programs like Steam, flatpaks, GIMP, Kdenlive, etc. It may not be the best looking, but it ensures productivity and entertainment at best.


SAYING IT AGAIN:
I only place this file for backups in case my configuration.nix file is corrupted from wrong editing. You can use it as well, but make sure you make a backup of your configuration.nix.
